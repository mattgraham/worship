[G]Lord, I [C]lift your name on [D]high   [C]
[G]Lord, I [C]love to sing your [D]praises [C]
[G]I'm so [C]glad you're in my [D]life   [C]
[G]I'm so [C]glad you came to [D]save us  [C]

[G]You came from [C]heaven to [D]earth to [C]show the [G]way
From the [C]earth to the [D]cross My [C]debt to [G]pay
From the [C]cross to the [D]grave
From the [Em]grave to the [Am]sky
Lord, I [D]lift your name on [G]high
