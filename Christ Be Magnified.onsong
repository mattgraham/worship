Verse 1:
Were cre[A]ation suddenly artic[D2]ulate
With a [A]thousand tongues to lift on[D2]e cry
Then from [A/C#]north to south and [D2]east to west
We'd hear [A/E]Christ be [E(add4)]magnified! [A]      [E]     [D2]

Verse 2:
Were the [A]whole earth echoing His em[D2]inence
His [A]name would burst from sea and [D2]sky
From [A/C#]rivers to the [D2]mountaintops
We'd hear "[A/E]Christ be [E(add4)]magnified![A]"       [A2]         [A]

Chorus:
[A]O Christ be [Asus/B]magnifie[D2]d
Let His [Esus]praise ari[F#m7]se
Christ be [Esus]magnif[D2]ied in me
[A]O Christ be [Asus/B]magnifie[D2]d
From the altar [Esus]of my li[F#m7]fe
Christ be [Esus]magnif[D2]ied in me

Verse 3:
When every [A]creature finds its inmost mel[D2]ody
And every [A]human heart its native [D2]cry
Oh then in [A/C#]one enraptured [D2]hymn of praise
We'll sing "[A/E]Christ be[E(add4)] magnifie[D2]d!"  [D6]           [A/D]           [D2]

Interlude:

Bridge:
[D2]I won't bow to idols
I'll stand [E(add4)]strong and worship You
If it [F#m7]puts me in the fire
I'll re[A/C#]joice â€˜cause You're there too
I [D2]won't be formed by feelings
I hold [E(add4)]fast to what is true
If the [F#m7]cross brings transformation
Then I'll be c[A/C#]rucified with You
'Cause [D2]death is just the doorway
Into [E(add4)]resurrection life
If I [F#m7]join You in Your sufferings
Then I'll [A/C#]join You when You rise
And when [D2]You return in glory
With all the [E(add4)]angels and the saints
My [F#m7]heart will still be singing
And my [E(add4)]song will be the same

Final Chorus:
[A]O Christ be [Asus/B]magnifie[D2]d
Let His [Esus]praise ari[F#m7]se
Christ be [Esus]magnif[D2]ied in me
[A/E]O Christ be magnif[F#m7]ied
From the altar of my li[A/C#]fe
Christ be [Esus]magnif[D2]ied in me  [A]
