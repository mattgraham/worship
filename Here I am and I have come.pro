{st: Thank You Lord}
Here I [D2]am and I have come 
to thank you lord for [G2/D]all you've done 
T[D2]hank you lord
You paid the price at calvary 
you shed your blood, [G2/D]you set me free
T[D2]hank you lord

No [A7sus]greater love [G]was [A7]ever shown 
no [G]better [D2]life ever was laid down (Bass[G][G][B][C#][D])

And [D2]I will always love your [G]name 
And [A7sus]I will always [D2]sing your praise
(repeat)

You took my sin you took my shame 
you drank my cup you bore my pain thank you lord 
You broke the curse you broke the chains 
in victory from death you rose again thank you lord
Not by works but by your grace 
you clothe me now in your righteousness


When we come you make me whole 
you give me peace you restore my soul thank you lord
You fill me up and when I�m full 
you give me more till I overflow thank you lord
You�re making me to be like you 
to do the works of the father  too
